## Get started

### Claude Code (via the JUXT plugin marketplace)

```
/plugin marketplace add juxt/claude-plugins
/plugin install allium
```

### Cursor, Windsurf, Aider, Continue and other skills-compatible tools

```
npx skills add juxt/allium
```

### GitHub Copilot

Copilot reads skills and agents from the repository automatically. No installation needed.

### Manual installation

Allium is just markdown files. If your tool isn't listed above, or you prefer to manage things yourself, grab the files from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/juxt/allium) and place them wherever your LLM reads custom instructions from.

## The command line tool

The `allium` CLI is optional, but strongly advised. It validates, parses and analyses your specification files, and some of Allium's most compelling benefits arise from it. With the CLI installed, your LLM checks every `.allium` file after writing or editing it, catching structural errors before they accumulate, and can run process-level analysis such as data flow, reachability and deadlock detection.

Pick the method that suits your platform. Pre-built binaries for macOS, Windows and Linux, along with source, live in the [Allium-Tools repository](https://github.com/juxt/allium-tools); grab the latest from the [releases page](https://github.com/juxt/allium-tools/releases).

### macOS

Homebrew is the simplest route:

```bash
brew tap juxt/allium && brew install allium
```

If you already have a Rust toolchain, you can install from crates.io instead:

```bash
cargo install allium-cli
```

### Windows

Download the latest `.exe` from the [releases page](https://github.com/juxt/allium-tools/releases) and place it somewhere on your `PATH`. With a Rust toolchain installed, `cargo install allium-cli` also works.

### Linux

Install from crates.io with a Rust toolchain:

```bash
cargo install allium-cli
```

Arch users can install from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/allium-tools). Pre-built binaries are also on the [releases page](https://github.com/juxt/allium-tools/releases).

### From source

Clone the [Allium-Tools repository](https://github.com/juxt/allium-tools) and build with `cargo build --release`. The binary lands in `target/release`.

## Using Allium

Type `/allium` to get started. This is an entry point that examines your project and guides you toward the right skill, whether that's distilling a spec from existing code or building one through conversation. Once you're familiar with the individual skills, you'll likely invoke them directly.

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/allium` | Entry point. Examines your project and routes you to the right skill. |
| `/allium:elicit` | Build a spec through structured conversation. |
| `/allium:distill` | Extract a spec from existing code. |
| `/allium:propagate` | Generate tests from a spec. |
| `/allium:tend` | Targeted changes to existing specs. |
| `/allium:weed` | Find and fix divergences between spec and code. |

Skills use the fully qualified form `/allium:skill` across all editors. Some editors also allow the short form (`/tend`, `/elicit`) when there's no ambiguity. The `/allium` entry point may not be available in all editors; if it isn't, reach for `/allium:elicit` or `/allium:distill` directly.

      <span class="marker">✻</span> I can see you have an existing codebase with order processing, inventory management and a shipping module, but no Allium spec yet. I can distill from code to capture what your implementation currently does, or start from intent to build a spec through conversation. Which would you prefer?

Allium determines whether to distill from existing code or build a new spec based on your project and what you ask for. See the [usage examples](usage) for what happens next.
